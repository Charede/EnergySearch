<h3>The website looks kind of ugly?</h3>
<br>
<p><i>The CSS and appearance of the website was generated by ChatGPT and things added over time as needed. I, unfortunatley, am not that good when it comes to designing the appearance of websites. I will accept any CSS improvements via a support ticket.</i></p>
<h3>The website looks terrible on mobile?</h3>

<h3>Why not put ads on the website?</h3>
<br>
