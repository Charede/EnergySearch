<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<br><h3>I have a question that is not answered here? I want to suggest a feature or report something that is not working?</h3>
<br>
<p><i>Feel free to open a support ticket on the <a href="https://discord.gamer2020.net">Gamer2020 Discord</a>. Please be patient in waiting for a response.</i></p>
<br><h3>I want to help with the website, how can I help?</h3>
<br>
<p><i>There are no current plans to make the source code public to the website for security reasons. Feel free to send anything you think would help via a support ticket.</i></p>
<br><h3>The website looks kind of ugly?</h3>
<br>
<p><i>The CSS and appearance of the website was generated by ChatGPT and things added over time as needed. I, unfortunatley, am not that good when it comes to designing the appearance of websites. I will accept any CSS improvements via a support ticket.</i></p>
<br><h3>The website looks terrible on mobile?</h3>
<br>
<p><i>I'm aware of this. It looks fine on a widescreen, I will try to fix this at some point.</i></p>
<br><h3>Can I donate to the website?</h3>
<br>
<p><i>Everything on the website is available at no charge. There is no need to donate anything. As long as I can afford the operating costs I will not ask for donations.</i></p>
<br><h3>Why not put ads on the website?</h3>
<br>
<p><i>This is something I am considering. I would like to minimize load times and have no cookies or anything similar on the website. In my experiance most people these days use ad blockers so there wouldn't be much revenue from that anyway.</i></p>
<br><h3>What sources are used for decks?</h3>
<br>
<p><i>Currently YouTube channels are learned currently and more things planned in the future.</i></p>
<br><h3>I know of a good youtube channel but it's decks aren't on the site?</h3>
<br>
<p><i>New channels are added automatically but process is slow as YouTube has API limits. You can submit a ticket and I can make sure it is in the queue.</i></p>
<br><h3>A deck list for a Youtube video isn't learned properly? A channel that is learned by the site is missing videos? I copied a list but it failed to import.</h3>
<br>
<p><i>For the best success, YouTube creators should just copy and paste the list exported from PTCGO/PTCGL. Some creators make edits to the lists for whatever reason and sometimes there are issues with deck lists because of this. Some measures to help with this are inplemented into the deck learning proccess but it is hard to account for every little thing.</i></p>
<br><h3>How often are new features implemented? The site is missing stuff? I have an idea for soemthing that should be added?</h3>
<br>
<p><i>The time needed to add new features can vary. This depends on how complicated the feature is and real life responsibilites. Plenty of features are in mind that are not impleneted at launch. If you have an idea for something to be added please submit it via a discord ticket.</i></p>
<br><h3>There are cards missing on the website? A card has incorrect info?</h3>
<br>
<p><i>Cards are updated from the Pokemon TCG API. When the API is updated the site will as well.</i></p>
<br><h3>The site should learn deck lists from X source. I would like to recommend some sources.</h3>
<br>
<p><i>Submit them via a Discord ticket. Adding new sources will take time.</i></p>
