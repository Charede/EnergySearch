		<li><a href="https://pokemontcg.io/">Pokemon TCG API</a></li> Cards are pulled from this API. This has been a godsend that didn't exist when I coded the first version of Energy Search. I don't have to worry as much about having all the data and can focus on other features.
		<li><a href="https://github.com/PokemonTCG/pokemon-tcg-sdk-php">pokemon-tcg-sdk-php</a></li> This SDK is used by the php scripts that download the card data from the API.
		<li><a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT</a></li> This is another godsend. The ability to quickly generate code has helped to rewrite Energy Search faster than if done by hand. (Even the initial HTML/CSS that will be updated eventually was made by it.) With the right guidance and logic this is an invaluable coding tool.
