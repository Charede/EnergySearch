<h1>About Energy Search!</h1>
<p>I recently decided to play the Pokemon Trading Game again after many years of not playing. Back when the original Energy Search was made there weren't really many websites to share decklists. Now it it seems there are several places to find deck lists. While this is great, it was a little hard for me to find exactly what I was looking for. I would look at deck profile videos on YouTube but those type of searches have limitations and you are feed stuff based on the algorithm. I had an idea, what if there was a search engine for deck lists, kind of like Google? In 2023 there have been plenty of advancements and I knew I wouldn't have to worry about certain things like maintaining card data. (I remember having to build the card databases from the clacky plugin with the original site.) I decided to bring back Energy Search but not in it's original form. I wanted something that could index deck lists and have them searchable. I started with YouTube videos as a POC and have had some success. Now that things are working, I plan to add more sources as time goes on. I also need to work on bringing many features that used to exist on the original site to this brand new one. I hope this website can help other players with finding deck lists they are looking for.</p>

<h1>Original About Page Text from 2016</h1>
<p> The basic idea for this website is to be a way for players to be able to share deck lists and ideas with each other. Once registered users can post deck lists for others to see and give feedback on. This can be a good way for new users to learn about new decks and for more experienced players to bounce ideas around.</p>
<p> This website was started in the hope that it will be useful to the players and collectors of the Pok√©mon TCG. The goal of this website is to be a medium for people to learn about the game and to interact with other players/collectors. This site is non-profit and all content is available for free. Some features require that you have an account but registration is free.</p>
<p> This website is intended for everyone ranging from beginners to professional players. It is my goal that people will find this website useful in some way. This website will always be a work in progress and improvements will be made over time.</p>
<p> I created this website simply because I have loved this card game ever since it came out. I have made many new friends and have had a lot of fun because of this card game. This website is my way of contributing to the game in the best way I can.</p>
